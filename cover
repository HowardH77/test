Dear Sir,
In reference to your job posting, I have attached my resume for your consideration.  After reviewing your needs, I feel 
my skills and experience fit your requirements.

In my present position, I am the primary shell script developer refactoring and redesigning the overnight pricing 
infrastructure code for YieldBook (a fixed income analytics system).  The work entails rewriting legacy applications and 
adapting new code, creating new database tables and stored procedures, and migrating and loading the data to the new 
system.  In addition, my other responsibilities include code performance tuning, simple report writing, meeting with 
clients and other development groups, and also off hours support and root cause trouble shooting analysis and correction. 

I have extensive applications development experience ranging from trading systems, ETL systems, legacy code migrations, 
database and minor systems administration and also customized software tools development.  I look forward to discussing 
my qualifications with you.

Sincerely,
Howard Hong

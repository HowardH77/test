  M38 (open cluster) :

Camelopardalis
  Kemble’s Cascade (asterism) : Midway between Polaris and Capella,
     then shift about one binocular field (7°) toward Alpha Persei.

Ursa Major
  M81/M82 (galaxies) : draw a line from Phecda to Dubhe, (the top two bright stars in the big dipper).
    Extend that line past Dubhe for the same distance you just traversed, Watch for 24 Ursae Majoris
    lying at the right angle of a small triangle.  The triangle points southeast to M81, two degrees away.
  M101 (galaxy) : Mizar -> Alcor -> follow ladder of four 5th-magnitude stars to 86 Ursae Majoris.
    From there look to the north for three 7th-magnitude stars set in a right triangle.
    M101 lies just east of the midpoint along the triangle’s hypotenuse.
    Note: Use nebula filter
